ARCADEA

## Overview

Arcadea is a game library app designed for passionate gamers who crave variety and organization, encompassing the entire spectrum of gaming - from the latest AAA releases to beloved indie gems and timeless classics.

### Problem

Gamers often end up with games scattered across multiple platforms and launchers (Steam, Epic, consoles, etc.). This makes it hard to keep track of your entire collection, discover what you already own, and decide what to play next. Arcadea solves this by being an all-in-one hub.

Decision Paralysis: "What should I play tonight?" Arcadea's curated recommendation system and powerful filters combat that overwhelming feeling.
Losing Track of Your Backlog: Arcadea's custom tagging and filtering systems let you effectively manage that ever-growing list of games you want to try.

Core Library Architecture: Design a database to store game data (title, platform, cover art, release date, genres, etc.).

Visual Library Display: Choose a primary display mode (cover art grid, list, or arcade cabinets) and implement sorting options (title, platform, release date).
Basic Filtering: Start with filters for genre and platform.


Phase 2:  Enhanced Functionality

Personal Ratings & Notes: Allow users to rate games and add their own notes.


## Nice-to-haves

Social Features (Optional): Consider a basic friends system and simple review sharing features.
